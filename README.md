# Plant Disease Detection Using CNN

This project is designed to detect plant diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model is trained on the PlantVillage dataset, which contains images of tomato leaves with various diseases. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and a simple GUI for selecting images to predict plant diseases.

## Features

- Preprocesses images by resizing and normalizing.
- Trains a CNN model to classify images into various disease categories.
- Saves and loads trained models and training history.
- Evaluates model performance on test data.
- Provides visualizations for training history and confusion matrix.
- Includes a GUI for users to select images and get disease predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is from PlantVillage, which contains images of tomato leaves with the following diseases:

- Bacterial Spot
- Early Blight
- Healthy
- Late Blight
- Leaf Mold
- Septoria Leaf Spot
- Spider Mites
- Target Spot
- Tomato Mosaic Virus
- Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus

## Directory Structure

- `PlantVillage/`: Directory containing subdirectories of images for each disease.
- `images.npy`: Preprocessed image data (generated by the script).
- `labels.npy`: Preprocessed label data (generated by the script).
- `plant_disease_detection_model.h5`: Saved trained model.
- `training_history.pkl`: Saved training history.
